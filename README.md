## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I typically begin by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. I focus on the main components first, like textures, lighting, and the environment in the context of 3D graphics. Once these are established, I refine the details gradually, iterating on the design to improve the final product.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me improve my ability to work with 3D assets, manage textures, lighting, and optimize rendering. I gained hands-on experience in managing complex visual elements and translating abstract concepts into real, interactive visual environments.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started with basic shapes and concepts, followed by creating wireframes and testing different textures and lighting. I iterated on the design by continuously refining the scene’s components and ensuring they worked cohesively together.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative approach of designing and testing small components individually before integrating them is something I will definitely apply in future projects. It ensures that issues are caught early and allows for better control over complex systems.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development by breaking the project into smaller, manageable tasks, such as working on individual textures or lighting first. This helps in reducing complexity and ensures each part functions as expected before moving forward.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used a modular approach in organizing my code and assets, allowing me to test different parts of the scene independently. I also used version control to track changes and avoid losing progress.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential throughout the development process. I continuously tested and refined individual parts of the scene, such as lighting and textures, ensuring the overall scene improved with each iteration.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At the start, my focus was on building the core elements of the scene. As I progressed, I became more organized in my code, ensuring modularity and flexibility as the scene grew more complex. This evolution helped in managing the complexity of the final project.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me develop problem-solving skills that are essential in many areas of technology. It gives me the tools to tackle complex problems, whether in graphics programming, software development, or any other technical field.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Learning computational graphics has taught me a lot about visualizing complex systems and creating realistic environments. These skills will be valuable in future courses related to game development, simulation, or any field that involves 3D modeling.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The skills I gained in computational graphics, such as optimizing 3D models and handling visual effects, will be useful in many technical fields, including game development, virtual reality, and data visualization. These skills will also help me in roles that require understanding complex visual representations of data.
